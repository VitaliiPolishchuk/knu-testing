The Gestalt school had a revolutionary impact on the field of visual
perception in the early 1900s. As a consequence, it has long been thought
that access to shape/object memories can occur only after the visual field has
been organized into figures and grounds. That is, it has been assumed that
figure–ground assignment is immune to influences from memory, even from
memories that are intrinsically visual (e.g., memory for shape or object
structure). Of course, the figure–ground-first assumption entails the belief
that a line separating perception and memory can be drawn somewhere
between figure assignment and memories of shape or object structure.
Research in Peterson’s laboratory has shown that the Gestalt-based figure–
ground-first assumption is incorrect, however. Some form of shape/object
memory is accessed before, and contributes to, figure assignment.
In this chapter, we begin by showing that the evidence that long served to
support the figure-ground-first assumption is really quite weak (Section II).
Section III reviews Peterson and her colleague’s early work revealing shape
and object memory effects on figure assignment. In this early work,
observers reported their subjective impression of where the figure lay with
respect to the border of interest; in other words, figure–ground perception
was assessed via direct report. In Section IV, a number of questions are
reopened by the findings of Peterson and her colleagues, questions for which
answers generated within the figure-ground-first assumption are no longer
valid. We review some research conducted to answer these questions and
introduce a new model of figure assignment (Peterson, 2000; Peterson,
de Gelder, Rapcsak, Gerhardstein, & Bachoud-Le´vi, 2000). In this model,
memory of shape/object structure serves as one of an ensemble of figure
cues, along with the Gestalt configural cues. This model does not represent
a return to the Structuralist tradition where past experience was the only
organizing factor, or even the dominant organizing factor. In Section V,
we describe some recent experiments testing the competitive model. In
these experiments, processes involved in figure assignment are assessed
indirectly via a priming paradigm. In Section VI, we review an experiment
showing that a single past experience with a novel border exerts a
measurable influence on figure assignment the next time the border is
encountered. The chapter ends with some remarks on learning, memory,
and perception.

A third phenomenon of evidence for the figure-ground-first assumption is
the well-known coupling between figural status and conscious recognition,
illustrated by the Rubin vase-faces display in Figure 1C. The vase can be
recognized when the central black region appears to be the figure at the
border it shares with the adjacent white region, but not when it appears to
be ground to the surrounding white region. Likewise, the faces can be
recognized when the surrounding white region appears to be the figure at the
vertical borders it shares with the black region, but not when the white
region appears to be ground at those borders. This coupling between
figural status and recognition led many vision scientists to accept the figureground-first
assumption. A coupling cannot provide unequivocal evidence
for a serial sequence, however.
Surprisingly, until the initial tests conducted in our laboratory were
published in 1991 (Peterson & Gibson, 1991; Peterson, Harvey, &
Weidenbacher, 1991), there were very few direct tests of whether past
experience contributed to figure assignment. A few experiments had
suggested that aspects of past experience might affect figure assignment
(Schaffer & Murphy, 1943; Rubin, 1958). These results were dismissed
based on procedural criticisms, desultory attempts (and failures) to
replicate, and alternative interpretations that did not fit the data any better
than the original interpretation did (for review, see Peterson, 1995, 1999).
The Gestalt arguments against the Structuralist tradition continued to exert
a strong hold on perception psychologists who, despite evidence that
memory and past experience affected many other visual processes,
continued to believe that figure–ground assignment lay far enough below
an implicit line dividing perception from memory to be immune to
influences from memory.
and white regions sketched portions of known objects on the white side
(standing women in Figure 2A, and face profiles in Figure 2B). Peterson
et al. (1991) showed these displays to observers who viewed them for long
durations (30–40 seconds) and reported continuously whether the black or
the white region appeared to be figure by pressing one of two keys.
Observers viewed all displays in both an upright orientation, as shown in
Figure 2, and in an inverted orientation (which can be seen by turning the
book upside down). Changing the orientation from upright to inverted did
not change the Gestalt configural cues: the center black region is enclosed,
symmetric, and smaller in area than the surrounding white region both when
the display is upright and when it is inverted. Nor did it change the
monocular depth cue of interposition in Figure 2B, or the fact that observers
fixated the black region on all trials. However, when the display is upright,
the known object sketched on the white side of the black–white border is
portrayed in its typical orientation, whereas when the display is inverted, the
known object is disoriented from its typical upright.
Access to shape and object memories is orientation specific. For instance,
it takes longer for observers to identify objects and pictures of objects that
are disoriented from their typical upright orientation (Jolicœur, 1988; Tarr
& Pinker, 1989). Perrett, Oram, and Ashbridge (1998) have shown that it
takes longer for a population of cells coding an object to reach some
threshold if the object is shown in an atypical orientation. The orientation
specificity of object recognition led Peterson and her colleagues to
hypothesize that changing the orientation of the displays might reveal
object memory effects on figure assignment by modulating them.
Specifically, if object memories affect figure assignment, their influence
should be larger for upright displays than for inverted displays. Therefore,

Importantly, Peterson et al. (1991) found that knowledge could not
overcome the effects of changing the orientation or rearranging the parts.
The orientation effects were obtained even if observers knew that the displays
portrayed inverted women or inverted face profiles; the same was true for the
effects of scrambling the parts. This finding indicated that knowledge of any
type could not produce these effects; access to memories of object structure
via the visual input was necessary (see also Gibson & Peterson, 1994).
The results obtained by Peterson et al. (1991) indicated that memories of
object structure (at least) are accessed in the course of figure assignment and
affect its outcome. It was clear in the original experiments that semantic
knowledge alone was insufficient for these effects, the proper structure of the
object was necessary. Peterson and Gibson (1991, 1994b; Gibson &
Peterson, 1994) showed that the Peterson et al. (1991) results extended to
masked displays exposed for brief durations (as short as 28 ms).
The initial results showing that object memories affected figure
assignment were obtained using displays that were biased against seeing
the figure lying on the side of the border where a well-known object was
sketched. Later, Peterson and Gibson (1994a; Gibson & Peterson, 1994)
tested whether object memories affected figure assignment using displays,
such as those in Figure 4A, in which object structure was the only cue that
reliably distinguished between the regions on either side of a central border.
They found orientation effects for these displays as well: Observers were
more likely to report seeing the figure on the side of the border where the
well-known object was sketched when the displays were upright rather than
inverted. Thus, object memory effects on figure assignment were evident
both with displays that should have been unambiguous if only the
traditional Gestalt cues were taken to be relevant to figure assignment
(e.g., the displays in Figure 2) and with displays that were ambiguous in that
configural cues were equated for the two adjacent regions (e.g., displays like
those in Figure 4A).
In a different series of experiments, Peterson and Gibson (1993) added
binocular disparity to displays like those in Figure 4A in which object
memory favored seeing the figure on one side of a border, but Gestalt
configural cues did not reliably distinguish between the two sides. Binocular
disparity indicated that the figure lay either on the same side or on the
opposite side of the border as the known object. Peterson and Gibson
expected that when both object memory and binocular disparity specified
that the figure lay on the same side of the border, the displays would be
unambiguous. The stimuli in which object memory and binocular disparity
specified that the figure lay on opposite sides of the border were the
interesting case. If the addition of binocular disparity rendered the displays
A first set of questions is the following. How can object memories be
accessed before figure–ground organization has been imposed on the visual
field; that is, before shaped figures have been separated from shapeless
grounds? What serves as the substrate for access to object memories? Must
we return to the Structuralist claim that past experience can be accessed by
completely unorganized pointillistic input?
In response to these questions, Peterson and Gibson (1993, 1994b)
proposed that at least the initial stages of edge extraction precede access to
object memories and that edges, rather than shaped entities or even whole
regions, were the substrate for matches to shape and object memories. They
argued that edge-based access to memories of object structure could occur at
the same time that the Gestalt configural cues are being assessed. This would
allow memories of object structure to serve as one more figural cue (i.e., to
add to the traditional ensemble of Gestalt configural cues).
Further, Peterson and Gibson (1993) argued that not all edges could
support object memory effects on figure assignment. One critical requirement
is that edges must be extracted early in processing; only such edges can
support quick access to object memories. Evidence that object memories
must be accessed quickly if they are to affect figure assignment comes from
the orientation effects. Inverted stimuli do access memories of familiar

A second set of questions that was raised by Peterson and colleague’s
challenge to the figure–ground-first assumption concerns the behavior of
visual agnosic patients, such as the one tested by Warrington and Taylor
(1973). If tested with displays designed to reveal object memory effects on
figure assignment, will visual agnosics behave like normal observers or will
they fail to show effects of object memories on figure assignment? If a visual
agnosic cannot identify the objects portrayed in figure–ground displays, yet
shows spared object memory effects on figure assignment, that would
suggest that impaired identification responses cannot be taken to support a
serial view of the relationship between figure–ground assignment and access
to memories of object structure.
To address these questions, Peterson et al. (2000) tested a visual agnosic
patient, A.D. They assessed A.D.’s object recognition/identification abilities
via a battery of standard tests, including the Boston Naming Test, the
impossible objects subtest of the Birmingham Object Recognition Battery
(the BORB, Riddoch & Humphreys, 1993), and the Visual Object and
Spatial Perception Battery (VOSP, Warrington & James, 1991). These tests
require either a naming response or a decision regarding whether a depicted
object is a familiar object or a novel (or impossible) object. The VOSP
